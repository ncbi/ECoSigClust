# Mutational Signatures as Sensors of Environmental Exposures

Mutational  signatures can be used as sensors of the exposure level to environmental factors, allowing to investigate the impact of the mutagenic environmental factors on the biological processes in the affected genomes. For pathway-level level analysis combining mutational signatures together with gene expression, we used
a clustering algorithm named **ECoSigClust**. 

Please see [1] for the details of the analysis results. An older version [2] of **ECoSigClust**  is available [here](https://github.com/yooah/NetSig).
